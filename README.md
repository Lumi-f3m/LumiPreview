# LumiPreview
It's a preview of html that allows the user to preview html in simple terms.

The window is resizeable (from the bottom left) and dragable (from the top-bar)

## How do I use this?
You can do 2 things.
### 1. 
You can either have an html file, click the "Open in about:blank" button, or "Open in New tab" button (They are both the same Rn)
### 2.
You can paste your html code into the text area and you could click "Open in about:blank" button, or "Open in New tab" button (They are both the same Rn)

## Dark mode
You can click the button all the way at the bottom. I recommend using this button if your eyes hurt looking at a white ahh screen...
